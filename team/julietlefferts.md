### Overview
Juliet Lefferts started her academic career at Utrecht University in 2011. Both her Bachelors and Masters degree were research orientated. During her studies she performed multiple research internships including internships at the Department of Biopharmaceutics at Utrecht University and the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics at Oxford University. Her PhD research focuses on combining molecular research with translational measurements in Cystic Fibrosis patient-derived organoid models. 

Juliet: "I enjoy working at the Beekman lab because I can perform molecular research whilst staying connected to the clinic. This allows me to perform the research I like doing most, but as we are close to the clinic the translational aspect is always present which makes the research very valuable."
