### Overview
Since the end of 2021, I work as coordinator translational research in the Beekman lab. My focus lies on biobank maintenance and development. So far, more than 900 donors have entrusted their tissue and data to a Beekman lab biobank. There are many practical and regulatory aspects to maintaining a biobank, such as making sure researchers can easily assess the available materials, and filing protocols for sample use at the Biobank Research Ethics Committee of the UMC Utrecht. I have close contact with both the lab and the clinic, since they are both involved in building and using the biobank. Besides my work at the Beekman lab, I also maintain other biobanks within the Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Utrecht. 

I studied Biology at Utrecht University and worked in several functions at the UMC Utrecht, among which as a clinical research employee. Because of this background, I both understand the research in the lab and have experience in studies with patients and how to arrange things in the hospital. Iâ€™m happy to combine those two worlds in my current position. Outside work hours, I am an avid cellist, I like to play board games and I sew and collect fabrics.
