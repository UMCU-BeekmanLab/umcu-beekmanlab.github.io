### Overview
Martijn Koppens studied Biotechnology at Wageningen University and Research where he specialized in Medical Biotechnology. He obtained his PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) in Amsterdam on the actions of epigenetic repressors in adult stem cells and cancer using a variety of organoids and in vivo models. He then moved to the University of Oxford where he continued to work on the intestine, but shifted to epithelial/stromal interaction during tissue regeneration, gaining experience in co-culturing, multiplex histological staining and quantified analysis. In 2020 he came back to the Netherlands where he started a joint project between the groups of Jeffrey Beekman and Sabine Fuchs. Combining his expertise with their research topics on pulmonary disease modelling and advanced metabolic disease therapies, Martijn designs new models for mitochondrial and stromal-related diseases, using organoid co-cultures and mitochondrial gene editing, and is applying these to develop novel treatment strategies.
