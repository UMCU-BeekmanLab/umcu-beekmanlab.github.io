### Overview
Dr. J.M. Beekman obtained a PhD in molecular immunology in 2004, and performed multiple post docs in molecular and cell biology within various immunological settings. In October 2010, he became principle investigator at the UMC Utrecht, and started a novel translational research line focusing on developing novel therapeutic strategies for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease characterized by aberrant ion and fluid homeostasis at mucosal surfaces leading to chronic infection and inflammation and early death around the 3rd to 4th decade of life. Since 2019 he is a full professor of Disease modelling at the UMC Utrecht.

‘People with chronic diseases living healthy lives: I strive to create breakthrough solutions for clinical needs of people with chronic diseases by scientific research that focuses on the development of novel diagnostic or therapeutic approaches. This requires a multidisciplinary approach in which basic and clinical research is aligned, and integrated with needs of patients, the private sector and regulatory authorities. Currently, I am particularly proud of leading a team that developed a highly innovative diagnostic assay that enables individualized therapy for people with cystic fibrosis that lead to direct clinical impact for people within 4 years after the initial discovery.’
