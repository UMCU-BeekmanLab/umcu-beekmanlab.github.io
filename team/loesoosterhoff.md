### Overview
Hey there! My name is Loes den Hertog – Oosterhoff and I work as a research technician in the lab of Jeff. Because of the close interaction we have with the clinic, I really enjoy the type research we do in this group. My background lies in the veterinary world; I started working as a veterinary technician in 2008. In 2010 I started my education in Biology and Medical Lab Research at Saxion Deventer, and after getting my degree I started working as a research technician at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. In 2020 I made the switch to human research at Jeff’s group, giving all my love for animals to our cat, Vinnie.
